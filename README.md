# googlemirror

Google used to host a Google Photos go client library at
https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/blob/master/photoslibrary/v1/photoslibrary-gen.go

This no longer appears to exist, so I'm mirroring my local copy as I need
to update my Google Drive scripts in order to call Google Photos directly
now that these two services are no longer syncing.
